    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <strong>October 2025</strong></p>
  </header>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Darslib</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”) handles information
    when you use the mobile application <strong>Darslib AI Study Companion</strong> (the “App”).
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We do <em>not</em> collect, sell, or share personal data. The App does not
    include advertising and does not use the Android Advertising ID. Any study notes, bookmarks, and
    preferences you create are stored locally on your device unless you explicitly export or share them.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1) Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No account required.</strong> The App can be used without creating an account or providing personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>No personal data collection.</strong> We do not ask for your name, email address, phone number, or other personally identifiable information.</li>
    <li><strong>No Advertising ID.</strong> The App does not access or use the Android Advertising ID and does not serve ads.</li>
    <li><strong>No third-party analytics by default.</strong> We do not embed third-party tracking SDKs for marketing or profiling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Information Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <p>
    Certain data such as study preferences, bookmarks, and cached content may be stored <strong>locally
    on your device</strong> to provide core functionality and offline use. This information stays on your
    device and is removed if you delete the App or clear the App’s data.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Optional Device Data</h2>
  <p>
    Your device and operating system may generate <em>non-identifying</em> technical information such as
    crash logs or performance metrics. If the operating system provides these to us (for example, through
    the app store’s developer console), we use them only to diagnose problems and improve stability. We do
    not use such information to identify you.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Permissions</h2>
  <p>The App may request basic permissions strictly to provide features, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internet</strong> – to load content and check for updates.</li>
    <!-- If you add notifications later, keep this line, otherwise delete it -->
    <li><strong>Notifications (optional)</strong> – only if you enable reminders or alerts inside the App.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Permissions are not used for advertising or tracking.</p>

  <h2>5) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App may be used by students. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you
    believe a child provided personal information to us, please contact us and we will remove it.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Data Sharing &amp; Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, rent, or trade user data. We do not share personal data with third parties. If in the
    future we integrate an opt-in cloud backup or sign-in, we will update this page to describe the data,
    purpose, and controls before enabling the feature.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect information. No method of
    transmission or storage is completely secure; use the App at your discretion.
  </p>

  <h2>8) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy as the App evolves. We will post the new version at this URL and
    update the “Last updated” date above. Material changes will be highlighted in the App where appropriate.
  </p>

  <h2>9) Contact Us</h2>
